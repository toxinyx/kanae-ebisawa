      Another long day, nothing much was different. By the time I woke up, mama was already gone. Pa didn’t even come home. They work so hard, all the time; I rarely see them, to no one’s surprise. Sometimes I… just really wish we could sit down and talk. There’s just never any time.</p>
      <p class="left">It’s always left to me to keep the house in check and look after little Kenta. Not that I’m complaining, of course, I adore him, but… when was the last time I really had time for me? He followed me everywhere today. Kept tugging on my sleeve and asking why the beams of our house creak when the wind blows. I told him that it’s because the wood is alive- that it breathes with us. He… liked that answer, I think. At least he seemed to.</p>
      <p class="left">After he finished breakfast, we went outside to tighten the ropes by the shed. My hands are still stinging from having to tighten them so much, but if I don't, the rain will push the wood loose; I really need pa to get round to fixing that. I might end up having to do it myself, I guess. Kenta tried to help, but the hammer was too heavy for him. He’d giggle everytime he dropped it; I laughed too, but part of me was worried he’d end up smashing his foot.</p>
      <p class="left">By the time the sun was at the peak, I was already exhausted. Not much to be done, considering there was still wood to cut and a floor to sweep.</p>
